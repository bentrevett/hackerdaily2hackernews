# hackerdaily2hackernews

![](icon48.png)

Sometimes I see a thread on [HackerDaily](https://hackerdaily.io/) and I want to read the comments on Hacker News instead. This extension adds a button that you can click when on a HackerDaily comment section to open the corresponding Hacker News thread.

I don't know why anyone else would use this, but I'd never made a Chrome extension before and I wanted to try it out.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable developer mode (top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" (top left)
5. Select the directory where you cloned this repository
